# Alt Text LabelerBot


To get a label for your Bluesky account, go to [@altheroes.bsky.app](https://bsky.app/profile/altheroes.bsky.social) and subscribe and like.

If at least 70% of your image posts in the last 30 days contain alt text you will receive a label within a few minutes. If you don't qualify for a label yet, don't worry! The Labelerbot will recalculate your percentage and adjust your label every time you post a new image.

If you have not received a label after 4 hours, please contact [@timburga.social](https://bsky.app/profile/timburga.social).
